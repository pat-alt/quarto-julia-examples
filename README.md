# quarto-julia-examples

The [`quarto-julia` repo](https://github.com/pat-alt/quarto-julia) is a simple Quarto extension that makes a number of Julia-themed Custom Formats for Quarto available. 

This repo uses that extension and builds a simple website on which you can find a number of examples that demonstrate how the extension can be used and what kind of output it can produce.
